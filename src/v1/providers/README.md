# Providers Directory

The `providers` directory is designated for code that interacts with external APIs and services. This ensures that the integration logic is organized and encapsulated within a dedicated structure, making it easier to maintain and manage external dependencies.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the `providers` directory is to house code for:
- Third-party API integrations (e.g., sending emails, payment processing, data fetching)
- External services configurations and setup
- Utility functions or classes that simplify the use of external libraries

## Example

A common example of code that would reside in the `providers` directory is `nodemailer`, which is a module for Node.js applications to send emails. By placing the configuration and usage logic for `nodemailer` within this directory, we can maintain clean separation of concerns and improve the modularity of our codebase.

## Structure

The typical structure of the `providers` directory might look like this:
